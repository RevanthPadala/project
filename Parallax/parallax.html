                    <p>Regardless of what your profession is, HTML and CSS are great skills to have. And even a little knowledge of these languages can make a big difference in your career. Just like having the ability to speak a foreign language, this sort of skill is helpful in almost all professions.</p><br><br>
                    <p>First, let’s review what HTML and CSS are.</p><br><br>
                    <p>HTML and CSS are the foundational languages of the web. HTML is a markup language that is used for developing web pages. CSS is a language that defines the presentation of a document written in HTML.</p>

                <h3>Better Understand the Web</h3>
                <p>Knowing the basics of HTML and CSS and how they're used to create web pages is a skill that will always be useful.</p><br><br>
                <p>They’re helpful tools for designers, marketing specialists, and many other professionals.</p><br><br>
                <p>For example, today's marketers must optimize, analyze, and develop landing pages, and perform many other related functions. Without at least a basic understanding of HTML and/or CSS, it’s impossible to get the best results.</p><br><br>
                <h3>Create Websites</h3>
                <p>Nowadays, it's quite easy to take a free Web template and build a website. But your website will look like everyone else’s!</p><br><br>
                <p>You can create the ideal website yourself – a personal, unique web page. And you don’t need to pay someone else to do it!</p><br><br>

                <h3>Javascript Is In The Browser</h3>
                <p>Javascript is the de facto language of the web, meaning your browser has it, and you can do all sorts of stuff to/in your browser without the pain of setting up environments and code editors, downloading compilers and learning how to use them and what not. This makes it the biggest reason why one should learn Javascript.</p><br><br>
                <h3>It’s Easy To Learn</h3>
                <p> There’s an opinion about Javascript that sometimes even after developing for ages, developers wouldn’t necessarily know even the basics of Javascript. That could’ve happened 5 – 10 years ago when most of them started with learning jQuery, not anymore.<br><br>Javascript is comparatively easy to learn than other programming languages, provided you learn properly. If you go through the curriculum of freecodecamp, the world’s most popular online coding bootcamp, you can start learning right away, and there’s a BIG community that is up for helping you out, by StackOverflow, IRC rooms and what not. Once you learn the basics of anything, pretty much everything builds easily after that.</p><br><br>
